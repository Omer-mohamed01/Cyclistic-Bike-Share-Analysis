# 🚴‍♂️Divvy Trips 2019
Analyze Cyclistic’s 2019 bike-share data to understand how annual members and casual riders use bikes differently — and provide recommendations to help convert casual riders into members.

## Data Used
<a href="https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">Divvy Bike Share System Data (2019 Q1–Q4)</a>
</br>
Used under a public data license for educational purposes.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study.
</br>
It follows the six-step data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.

## 🧩 Business Task
Identify usage differences between annual members and casual riders to support Cyclistic’s marketing strategy.

## 🧰 Tools Used
Excel & Power Query → Data cleaning, merging, and transformation
</br>
PivotTables & Charts → Statistical summaries and visualization
</br>
PowerPoint → Final presentation of insights and recommendations

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
Combined four quarterly datasets (Q1–Q4 2019, Divvy Trips)
</br>
Removed null and invalid records
</br>
Converted start/end times to durations (minutes)
</br>
Added derived columns: ride length, day of week, user type
</br>
Verified data consistency across files

## 📈 Key Insights
Members take 90% of all rides, primarily on weekdays for short, consistent commutes.
</br>
Casual riders take fewer but longer rides, mainly on weekends for leisure.
</br>
Average ride length: Casual ≈ 23 min | Members ≈ 12 min.
</br>
Gender distribution is similar across both groups but overall male-dominated.
</br>
Clear opportunity to convert weekend casual riders into annual members.

## 💡 Recommendations
Offer weekend or seasonal membership discounts to attract casual riders.
</br>
Highlight membership benefits (cost savings, convenience) in targeted campaigns.
</br>
Promote commuting plans and loyalty rewards to retain active members.
</br>
Focus marketing on recreational users during weekends and holidays

## 🧠 Outcome
This analysis provides data-driven insights for Cyclistic’s marketing strategy, emphasizing how understanding rider behavior can help increase membership conversion and long-term engagement.
